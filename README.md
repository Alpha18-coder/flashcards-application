# Flashcard App HTML5/CSS3/JS

## A Flashcard Application for Computer Science Students

CS students often need to review their knowledge to be prepared for exams at university or interviews, and an effective solution to this are flashcard applications such as anki.

However, most flashcard apps are not suitable for CS students because they are not easy to use, have a confusing interface and do not support code formatting to review topics such as data structures/algorithms.

Therefore, I created a flashcard website that provides CS students not only a rich text-editor that allow them insert code snippets, but also a spaced repetition algorithm that adapts to user's needs and preferences such as their deadlines.

## Features List:

- You can set a deadline or end date for your learning goal and the application will recalculate the intervals for you
- You can create your own flashcards with text, images or video.
- You can organize your flashcards into decks.
- You can track your progress by seeing how many cards are in each phase: new, learning, review or mastered.
- You can practice your flashcards in a random order and at any time **using the practice mode**.
- You can save your data locally or sign in with Google to sync your data across devices.
